This is a purpose built R package for data scientists and others who utilize data modeling. This package contains two functions Best_Loess_Span and Best_Smooth_Spline_df, for calculating the best span value to use during loess modeling, and the best df value to use during smooth spline modeling respectively. This is achieved through spliting the input data into a training and a testing set, as determined by the valid_method parameter. Then, the background code of the function will run a lowest mean square error (MSE) test along all of the defined span or df values, as defined in the span_seq and df_seq parameter, and then return the value(s) with the lowest corresponding MSE.

This will allow for a quick and easy selection of which span and df value to use when modeling data. This eliminates the need to by hand run simulations on your data, but rahter automates it so that you can get to the heart of your data more quickly and efficiently.
