Description: This packages has two functions, Best_Loess_Span and Best_Smooth_Spline_df, to determine the best span and df value respectively. Under these functions, we take in a data set with two variables, and output its respective best span or df value to use. This is determined based on the MSE method, of breaking the data into a training and testing set, and then seeing which span or df value produces the lowest resulting error.
